    // For XCTesting name testing functions by starting them with "test".
    // Also the function should accept no params and have no return types.
    // XC then recognises such a method as a test that should be run on the code. This is identified by the
    // diamond shape in the gutter to the left. Hovering over this turns it to a play button that will run the test!
